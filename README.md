## ✨ How It Is Different From Existing Solutions

🔹 Most news apps (like Google News, DailyHunt) organize news using categories (Sports, Politics, Tech),  
but **none provide map-based browsing** to explore news region-wise.

🔹 Existing GIS systems focus on disaster or government planning, but **not general news retrieval**.

🔹 Provides **spatial news intelligence** that is useful for travelers, journalists, students, police, and emergency response teams.
